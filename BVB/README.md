We introduce **BVB**, Blender-VideoBench, a benchmark that tests this ability
by asking agents to reconstruct real-world videos as animated Blender scenes.
For a fair comparison, every agent writes its reconstruction through the same
lightweight harness, **Mini-BVB**, in the same sandbox and under the same cost
limit. External asset libraries are not allowed.

## Overview

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://yoloytang.me/BVB/">
    <img src="assets/bvb-figure1.png?v=c12e59389209" alt="BVB Figure 1, benchmark overview and Overall cost frontier across 51 configurations">
  </a>
</p>

- **288 real indoor videos** from the VSI-Bench test split, drawn from
  ARKitScenes, ScanNet, and ScanNet++.
- **5,130 spatiotemporal questions**, with the same questions asked of every
  reconstruction.
- **51 agent configurations from ten model families**, all evaluated with the
  same sandbox and prompt.
- **Two complementary evaluation axes**. One measures paired video-QA
  retention, and the other measures similarity in a frozen video-embedding space.
- **No external asset libraries**. Agents build all geometry from Blender
  primitives and operators instead of retrieving existing meshes.
- **Animated, executable output**. Each submission is a Blender program and
  scene, not a caption or a static image.

The full interactive results are on the
[project page](https://yoloytang.me/BVB/#leaderboard), and a
[CSV snapshot of all 51 configurations](assets/bvb-results.csv) is included in
this repository. This README covers the benchmark and how to reproduce it.

## Why programmatic reconstruction?

Question answering measures what a model can say about a video.
Programmatic reconstruction asks the model to build a persistent 3D scene that
can be reopened, edited, animated, and rendered.

- **Vision is raw.** Pixels do not explicitly specify the scene that produced them.
- **Language is ambiguous.** Many incompatible scenes fit the same description.
- **Code is executable.** A scene program can be run, inspected, revised,
  and rendered from new viewpoints.

## Benchmark protocol

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/bvb-pipeline.png" alt="Mini-BVB reconstruction followed by Dual VQA and Latent Similarity evaluation">
</p>

1. **Reconstruct.** A cost-limited agent works inside a fresh Blender 4.2
   Docker sandbox with only two tools, `bash` and `frames`. It inspects the
   source video and writes an animated `result.blend`.
2. **Evaluate.** Scoring runs separately from the agent loop. The submitted
   scene is rendered to video, and the render is used for paired video QA and
   encoded by a frozen video model.

### Evaluation axes

| Axis | Signal | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| **Dual VQA (DV)** | Retention of answers that are correct on the source video | Whether the reconstruction keeps the content needed to answer questions about the source video |
| **Latent Similarity (LS)** | Frozen V-JEPA 2.1 similarity | How well layout and motion agree between the source clip and the rendered reconstruction |

Both axes use a 0–100 scale. Overall is their square-root mean, defined as

$$
\mathrm{Overall} = \left(\frac{\sqrt{\mathrm{DV}} + \sqrt{\mathrm{LS}}}{2}\right)^2.
$$

Compared with an arithmetic mean, this penalizes uneven performance across
the two axes more heavily. Failed reconstructions stay in the evaluation pool
and score zero on both axes.

## Run the benchmark

### 1. Prepare the source videos

BVB uses the real indoor clips from
[VSI-Bench](https://vision-x-nyu.github.io/thinking-in-space.github.io/).
This repository does not redistribute the source videos. Download them from
the upstream dataset and arrange them in the following layout.

```text
VSI-Bench/
  arkitscenes/<scene_id>.mp4
  scannet/<scene_id>.mp4
  scannetpp/<scene_id>.mp4
```

The tracked [`eval/test.jsonl`](eval/test.jsonl) defines the 288 scenes and
5,130 questions in BVB. Use this file to reproduce BVB instead of substituting
a different upstream split.

### 2. Build the Stage-1 sandbox

You need Python 3.10+, Docker, and `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`. Stage-2 rendering also
needs Blender installed on the host, and LS encoding needs a GPU. Start from the
repository root. The first command below moves into `sandbox/`, and the
remaining steps run from there.

```bash
cd sandbox
docker build -t bvb-sandbox:latest .
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Reconstruct a smoke-test subset

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."  # or the key required by your provider

.venv/bin/python run_agent.py \
  --model gpt-6-astra \
  --reasoning high \
  --output results/run_001 \
  --cost-limit 3.0 \
  --limit 5
```

Remove `--limit` to run all 288 scenes. Add `--resume` to skip scenes that
already have a `.blend` when restarting an interrupted run. See
[`sandbox/README.md`](sandbox/README.md) for full details on the harness and the
supported providers.

### 4. Render and evaluate the reconstructions

```bash
.venv/bin/python ../eval/batch_render_camera.py \
  --run results/run_001 \
  --num-frames 64 \
  --resume
```

This command only produces the camera renders and does not compute any
scores. If Blender is not on your `PATH`, set `BLENDER_BIN` to the Blender
executable. To score the renders, follow [`eval/README.md`](eval/README.md). It
covers Dual VQA scoring with the judge API, LS scoring with the frozen V-JEPA
encoder, and how to combine the two axes into Overall.

## Restore released run artifacts

Large Stage-1 artifacts are hosted outside GitHub in the Hugging Face dataset
repository `yunlong10/BVB-results`. You need access to this repository before
downloading. Run the following commands from the repository root.

```bash
python3 -m pip install huggingface_hub hf_transfer
hf auth login
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 python scripts/download_results.py
```

To restore a single run, pass its name with `--run`.

```bash
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 python scripts/download_results.py \
  --run mini-harness-gpt-5.6-sol-reasoning-high-run01
```
